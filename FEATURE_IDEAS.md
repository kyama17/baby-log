## Feature Ideas for Baby Log App

Here are some potential new features for the Baby Log App:

1.  **Track Feeding Times:**
    *   Allow users to log feeding times (breast milk, formula, solids).
    *   Include details like duration (for breastfeeding) or amount (for formula/solids).
    *   Display feeding logs alongside diaper changes.
    *   Consider adding notifications/reminders for feeding times.

2.  **Sleep Tracking:**
    *   Enable users to record when the baby sleeps and wakes up.
    *   Calculate total sleep duration for the day/night.
    *   Visualize sleep patterns (e.g., a timeline or a bar chart showing sleep cycles).
    *   Allow editing of sleep entries.

3.  **Growth Milestones & Health Log:**
    *   Provide a section to log important developmental milestones (e.g., first smile, rolling over, first steps, first words) with dates and notes.
    *   Allow users to track weight, height, and head circumference over time, possibly with a growth chart visualization.
    *   Include a section for health-related notes, such as vaccination records or symptoms during illness.
